Outstanding items:

*RGB to HSV conversion?
*KDE is different from matlab

*Number of no-balls is static const. Ideally would like to allow more options.
*Warnings in the NormalHue/ReddishHue/Value cpp files because floats are declared as doubles.
*Adjustment by proximity
*KDE uses std, memory allocation. Needs to be updated. This is also someone elses implementation.
*Updated to use OpenCV and open CV types
*The code is a mix of C/C++. Should make some of the modules their own objects to be more OO.
